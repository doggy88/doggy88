## About me
My name is Daniel Palfi as a junior software tester, I am passionate about quality assurance and continuously improving my skills. I completed a state-accredited training program and gained practical experience in various testing methodologies and tools, including manual testing, regression testing, functional testing, and test automation. 

Throughout my academic and professional career, I have demonstrated my ability to work collaboratively with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality software products on time and within budget. I am detail-oriented and analytical, with a keen eye for identifying and reporting defects effectively.

I am a proactive learner and always seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and skillset. I am excited to join a team that values continuous learning and encourages professional development. I am currently preparing for the ISTQB-CTFL exam to further improve my testing skills.

In addition to software testing, I also have experience in Python programming, web development, and IT support. I have completed a Python programming language course and developed a [website](https://doggy88.github.io/egyszeru-receptek/) that generates random recipes as a hobby project.

I am eager to contribute my skills and passion to a dynamic and innovative team. Please feel free to explore my GitHub repositories to learn more about my work and contact me if you're interested in collaborating.
